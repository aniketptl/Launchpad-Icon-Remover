# Launchpad Icon Remover

Manytimes while installing apps like Photoshop , Lightroom or big apps they come with preloaded crap that is actually part of the orignal app but it appears in launchpad too and gets annoying. This is real small utility  that removes whatever icon , you wish to remove from launchpad. 

Issue : Sometimes if the guest account creates db then problem might occur.
